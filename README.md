# CSCI201 Skills
This repository contains my code for Skills 1 and Skills 3 in the Skills project for CSCI 201. A video for Skill 2 was submitted to Gradescope, but no code because it is apart of a larger project.

A video explaination for Skill 1 can be found [here](https://youtu.be/0AdWygPprR0).
A video explaination for SKill 2 can be found [here](https://youtu.be/nEdQlm1ZvmI).

The live skill 3 P5.js project can be viewed at [this website](https://gbillington1.github.io/csci201-skills/) hosted with GitHub Pages.
